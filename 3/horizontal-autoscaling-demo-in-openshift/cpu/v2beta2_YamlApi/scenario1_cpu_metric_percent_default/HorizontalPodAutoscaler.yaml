  # behavior:
  # behavior configures the scaling behavior of the target in both Up and Down
  # directions (scaleUp and scaleDown fields respectively). If not set, the
  # default HPAScalingRules for scale up and scale down are used.
  
  #   scaleDown: {...} 
  #   scaleDown is scaling policy for scaling Down. If not set, the default value
  #   is to allow to scale down to minReplicas pods, with a 300 second
  #   stabilization window (i.e., the highest recommendation for the last 300sec
  #   is used). 

  #   scaleUp: {...}
  #   scaleUp is scaling policy for scaling Up. If not set, the default value is
  #   the higher of:
  #   * increase no more than 4 pods per 60 seconds
  #   * double the number of pods per 60 seconds No stabilization is used.
